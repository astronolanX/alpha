# Alpha

My portfolio, in progress.

The landing page arranges blocks on a grid—each one links to a project. The layout is randomized per visitor but stays consistent as you navigate around, so things are where you left them.

Built with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and Motion One.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

*This is the alpha. It'll grow.*
